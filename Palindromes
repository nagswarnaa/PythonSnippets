# Palindromes

Sure, let's take the string "racecar" as an example to visually illustrate how the dynamic programming table is constructed when finding the longest palindromic substring. Hereâ€™s how we would build the table step-by-step:

### Step 1: Initialization for Single Character Substrings
Every single character is a palindrome by itself, so we start by setting all the diagonal elements to `True`.

**Table after Step 1:**

|   | r | a | c | e | c | a | r |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| r | T |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| a |   | T |   |   |   |   |   |
| c |   |   | T |   |   |   |   |
| e |   |   |   | T |   |   |   |
| c |   |   |   |   | T |   |   |
| a |   |   |   |   |   | T |   |
| r |   |   |   |   |   |   | T |

### Step 2: Checking for Two Character Substrings
We check every consecutive pair of characters to see if they are the same. If they are, that substring is a palindrome.

**Table after Step 2:**

|   | r | a | c | e | c | a | r |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| r | T | F |   |   |   |   |   |
| a |   | T | F |   |   |   |   |
| c |   |   | T | F |   |   |   |
| e |   |   |   | T | F |   |   |
| c |   |   |   |   | T | F |   |
| a |   |   |   |   |   | T | T |
| r |   |   |   |   |   |   | T |

### Step 3: Substrings Longer than Two Characters
Now, we check larger substrings by using the rule: `dp[i][j] = s[i] == s[j] && dp[i+1][j-1]`.

- For substring "rac" (i = 0, j = 2), `dp[1][1]` is `True` and 'r' != 'c', so `dp[0][2]` is `False`.
- For substring "ace" (i = 1, j = 3), `dp[2][2]` is `True` and 'a' != 'e', so `dp[1][3]` is `False`.
- Continue this for all substrings of increasing lengths.

**Partial Table Example:**

|   | r | a | c | e | c | a | r |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| r | T | F | F |   |   |   |   |
| a |   | T | F | F |   |   |   |
| c |   |   | T | F | T |   |   |
| e |   |   |   | T | F | F |   |
| c |   |   |   |   | T | F | F |
| a |   |   |   |   |   | T | T |
| r |   |   |   |   |   |   | T |

- Notably, "cec" (i = 2, j = 4) is a palindrome because `dp[3][3]` is `True` and 'c' == 'c'.
- The entire string "racecar" (i = 0, j = 6) is also identified as a palindrome because `dp[1][5]` is `True` and 'r' == 'r'.

### Final Table and Result
This approach will give you a full table with the results for every possible substring. The longest palindromic substring can then be found by looking for the `True` values in the table that represent the longest substrings.

This visual method helps you see how dynamic programming fills in based on smaller, already computed results, allowing the algorithm to work efficiently. Would you like to see more details or help with coding this approach?
